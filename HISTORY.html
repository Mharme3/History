    <h2 style="color: cyan;"> <b> GOOD WIFE</b> </h2>
    <p style="color: white;">
        A good wife is a woman that fears God and is respectful not to be her husband only but to the people around her.<br>
        A good wife will always try to make sure her home is not on fire because of her attitude, she obey her husband and contributes positively to the developmental growth of the home.<br>
        A good wife will always keep the house neat and make sure her children learns how to do home chores without being forced to do so.<br>
        The Holy Bible vividly made us to understand that "He that finds a good thing and obtains favour from the lord".<br>
        Marriage is the best company on planet earth; originally there is no union like Marriage.<br>
        It took me several years to study marriage, this is the only part of life where every body's opinion is not valid.<br>
        it is the decision of just two parties to say "YES".<br>
